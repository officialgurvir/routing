# Open Development
All work on Nest happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.



# Semantic Versioning
Nest follows semantic versioning. We release patch versions for critical bugfixes, minor versions for new features or non-essential changes, and major versions for any breaking changes. When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance.



# Your First Pull Request
To help you get your feet wet and get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of _**good first issues**_ that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.



# Sending a Pull Request
We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. Your pull  request should have a before and after breif description and screenshot.
